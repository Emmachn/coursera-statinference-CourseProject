#Overview

This is the report for the project for the statistical inference class. In it, I will use simulation to explore inference and do some simple inferential data analysis. The project consists of two parts:

1. A simulation exercise.
2. Basic inferential data analysis.

The format and formulas here included are based off the [outline of the project](https://class.coursera.org/statinference-011/human_grading/view/courses/973519/assessments/4/submissions).

#Simulations

```{r}
lambda <- 0.2
miu <- 1/lambda
stdDev <- 1/lambda
numExponentials <- 40
numSimulations <- 1000

```


#Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean
